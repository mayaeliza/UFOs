# UFOs
## Overview:
Create website using JavaScript to analyze UFO sighting data. To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, we will alter code to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Resources:
  - JavaScript, CSS, HTML, VS Code Editor
  
## Results:
- The inclusion of additional search criteria allows for users to easily and effeciently search through a large data set.
Users can search by date, city, state, country, and type to filter for potential UFO sightings in an area or time that is relevant to them.

- Also, the filter search allows the user to filter by more than one criteria at a time.

## Summary:
One drawback of this webpage is the inability to force a refresh of the seach entries to start over without leaving the page. To run a new search you must start over. In the future it would be beneficial to add more filters such as duration of the event. Also, tags to sort through common words found in the comments about the events would be beneficial for having a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings.
